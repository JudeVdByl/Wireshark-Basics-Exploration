# Wireshark-Basics-Exploration
The goal of this project is to explore basic functionality within Wireshark by analyzing a `.pcapng` file. I answer specific questions by investigating packet details, identifying flags, calculating hashes, and locating embedded files. This serves as an introduction to network analysis techniques in Wireshark.
